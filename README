paintr
------

paintr is a web service that creates original images. 

To use paintr you will need the following installed:
    PHP
    phpFlickr
These may have other dependencies.

To run paintr locally use a command line like:

   /usr/local/php/bin/php paintr.php 

To run paintr from a web server, copy this folder to your web server documents 
directory. Make sure that php (i.e. the web server) can write to the paintr 
directory, and that it can write to the file current.id . 

I had the idea for paintr on 19th May 2005. The original title for the project 
was ``Artomator''. It was inspired by autodr, and in response to Harold Cohen's 
``Off The Shelf''. The colour handling routines were inspired by Cohen's 
``Colouring Without Seeing''.
