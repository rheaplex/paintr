Installing paintr
-----------------

To use paintr you will need the following installed:
PHP
phpFlickr
These may have additional dependencies.

To run paintr locally use a command line like:

   /usr/local/php5/bin/php paintr.php 

To run paintr from a web server, copy this folder to your web server documents 
directory. Make sure that php (i.e. the web server) can write to the paintr 
directory, and that it can write to the file current.id . 


Note

To compile the fullscreen app use:

javac -classpath /System/library/Java:. paintr_fullscreen.java
